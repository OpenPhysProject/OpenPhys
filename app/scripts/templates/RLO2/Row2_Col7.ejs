        Excited Nickel states reach the ground state by gamma decay.

        Gamma (&#947;) rays are a form of ionizing electromagnetic radiation, 
        and are uncharged (unlike &#945; and &#946; radiation). A gamma photon 
        is a packet of electromagnetic energy emitted from a nucleus in an excited state. &#947; ray 
        photons from <strong>nuclear decay</strong> have energies in the range 
        ~100keV â€¦10MeV.
        
        Often following the decay of a parent nuclide (by &#945;, &#946; or electron capture), 
        a daughter nuclide is left in an excited state

        to its ground state with emission of one or more &#947; photons, without any change of A or Z. 
        For example when Co-60 decays to an excited state of Ni-60 
        by &#946; decay, two gammas of energies 1.173 MeV and 1.332 MeV are rapidly emitted.

        &#947; rays are highly <strong>penetrating</strong> making them useful 
        medically, but also hazardous. Effective shielding requires a large 
        amount of mass, such as thick concrete walls. The main <strong>interaction 
        processes</strong> with matter (resulting in ionization and dose) are the
         photoelectric effect, Compton scattering, and electron-positron pair production.
