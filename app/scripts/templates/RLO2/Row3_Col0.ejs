        Many nuclear structure are not built to really 
        last, subject to the fundamentally probabilistic nature of the quantum world. 
        A single nucleus cannot age, but in a population the ever-present force of probability drives an 
        accumulation of decay over time. 
        Microscopic probabilistic events result in irreversible macroscopic change.

        This level introduces nuclear <strong>structure</strong> 
        and the factors that lead to decay of alpha, beta and gamma emitting nuclides and describes
        <strong>the nuclear shell model, energy levels, the weak force, and the internal conversion process.</strong>
