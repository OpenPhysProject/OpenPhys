        Alpha <i>radiation is a densely ionizing, but short range form of charged 
        particle radiation generated by heavy radioactive elements with low n/p 
        ratios, such as radon, radium, uranium and plutonium.</i>
        <br/><br/>
        <i>“These experiments show that uranium radiation is complex, and that 
        there are present at least two types of radiation - one that is very 
        readily absorbed, which will be termed for convenience the &#945; 
        radiation, and the other of a more penetrative character, which will be 
        termed the &#946; radiation.”</i> <strong>‘Uranium Radiation and the 
        Electrical Conduction produced by it.’ E. Rutherford, (Philosophical 
        Magazine Series 5 (47) Issue 284, 1899)</strong>

        Although of <strong>short range</strong> (few cm in air), alpha particles deposits a 
        large amount of energy per mm of travel. This property is termed high 
        <strong>Linear Energy Transfer (LET)</strong> radiation. This is very damaging to cells, 
        but due to the low penetration range is only hazardous if ingested or 
        inhaled (e.g. radon).
        <br/><br/>
        Alpha particles are fast <strong>helium nuclei</strong> (Z=2, N=2) with 
        kinetic energies in the range 3 MeV to 10 MeV, and velocities around 
        1/20<sup>th</sup> the speed of light. The helium-4 nuclide (Z=2, N=2) is 
        particularly stable and forms readily.
