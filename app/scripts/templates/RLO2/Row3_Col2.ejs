        The <i> Nuclear Shell Model </i> is based on the <strong>Pauli Exclusion Principle</strong> 
        applied separately to the two types of fermion found in the nucleus 
        (protons and neutrons). There is a close analogy between atom electronic shell 
        structure and nuclear shell structure. Both describe the existence of specific 
        <strong> energy levels</strong> and both exhibit enhanced stability for closed shell  
        configurations. 
        This concept of <strong>nuclear excitation
        </strong> is key in explaining <strong>nuclear transitions</strong> and 
        gamma emission. In the nuclear shell model there are a series of so-called 
        <strong>magic numbers</strong> (8,20,28,50,82,126) which possess powers 
        of extra stability and apply separately to Z and N. <strong>Doubly-magic
        </strong> nuclei, such as Helium-4 (Z=N=2), are exceptionally stable.
