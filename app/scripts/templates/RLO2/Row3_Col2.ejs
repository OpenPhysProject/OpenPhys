        <i>Nuclear Shell Model</i> â€“ based on the <strong>Pauli Exclusion Principle</strong>,
         but applied separately to the two types of fermions found in the nucleus 
        (protons and neutrons). There is a close analogy between electronic shell 
        structure and nuclear shell structure in terms of the existence of specific 
        <strong>nuclear energy levels</strong> and high stability for specific 
        configurations (closed shells). This concept of <strong>nuclear excitation
        </strong> is key in explaining <strong>nuclear transitions</strong> and 
        gamma emission. In the nuclear shell model there are a series of so-called 
        <strong>magic numbers</strong> (8,20,28,50,82,126) which possess powers 
        of extra stability and apply separately to Z and N. <strong>Doubly-magic
        </strong> nuclei, such as Helium-4 (Z=N=2), are exceptionally stable.
