<div class="rlo-content-title">200.1 Classical Physics (1800’s)</div>
<div class="rlo-content-body"><strong>‘Classical Physics’</strong> is a term that describes physics 
    prior to the last decade of the 19th Century. This 
    includes all of Sir Isaac Newton’s (1643 - 1727) work 
    on mechanics, optics and gravitation and also the 
    <strong>classical electromagnetism</strong> (↑) of James Clerk 
    Maxwell (1831 - 1879). Philosophically, this term also 
    encapsulates a <strong>mechanical world-view</strong> of definite 
    forces, momentum, energy and so on, and a dominant 
    metaphor of a clockwork universe, ruled by Newton’s 
    three laws of motion and his law of universal 
    gravitation.

    The technology of this world was quite advanced and included lenses, mirrors, 
    prisms, telescopes, microscopes, steam engines and timepieces, and was 
    sufficient to support industrialization. One major limitation of classical physics is 
    that it included no viable theory of atomic structure.
