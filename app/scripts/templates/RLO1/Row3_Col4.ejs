    In 1913 Niels Bohr proposed a classical orbital atomic 
    model, but with an <i>ad hoc</i> non-classical twist - 
    quantization of electron orbital <strong>angular momentum</strong> 
    (↑). His model made many correct and useful 
    predictions, but was clearly only a first step. Some of 
    the most useful results from this early quantum theory 
    were:
    <ul>
        <li>Existence of discrete electron energy levels,</li>
        <li>Transitions between levels explain discrete spectra,</li>
        <li>A derivation of the Rydberg formula for spectral lines.</li>
    </ul>
    <font color='crimson'>Nevertheless, there were also clear limitations of Bohr’s
    theory because it was only accurate for single-electron 
    atoms, and it was a semi-classical approach without 
    any explanation of why the quantization idea worked 
    so well. </font>
