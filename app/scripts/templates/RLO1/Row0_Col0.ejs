    <div class="rlo-content-body">
    A huge amount of physics is governed by
    electromagnetic (EM) phenomena, including 
    electricity, magnetism, optics, and 
    electromagnetic radiation (light, X-rays etc.). 
    Not included in this list are gravitation and the 
    two nuclear forces. The restriction to ‘classical’ 
    electromagnetism specifically excludes 
    quantum effects, such as the concept of a 
    photon as a particle of light. Classically EM 
    waves are treated as oscillating electric and 
    magnetic fields. Classical EM was developed in 
    the 19th Century by Michael Faraday, James 
    Clerk Maxwell, Oliver Heaviside and many 
    others. Maxwell’s equations (1864) for the 
    electric and magnetic fields neatly describe all 
    of classical electromagnetic.
