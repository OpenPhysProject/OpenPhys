            <li><strong>Special Relativity & Electron Spin</strong><br/>
                Adding special relativity and the spin of the electron results 
                in the Dirac Equation. This also produced a prediction of anti-matter.

            <li><strong>Quantization of the EM Field</strong><br/>
                By treating the electromagnetic fields as quantum (rather than 
                classical) results in a theory called Quantum electrodynamics. 
                This theory also  handles particle creation and annihilation.

            <li><strong>Interpretation of the QM wave function</strong><br/>
                In the ‘quantum foundations’ community it has been a long 
                standing matter of debate what the wave function actually means. 
                Many different interpretations have been offered, but there is 
                no consensus.
