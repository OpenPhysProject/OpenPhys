<div class="rlo-content-body">
    In the 1920s de Broglie conceived of unifying light and matter by also describing
matter as wave-like, by relating wavelength λ to momentum: p = h/λ using Planck’
s constant, h. Subsequently, Schrodinger formalized this by finding a wave 
equation to mathematically describe de Broglie’s waves. These were key steps in 
the development of <strong>Quantum Mechanics</strong>, which describes electrons bound in 
atoms in <strong>standing wave</strong> (↑) patterns.
