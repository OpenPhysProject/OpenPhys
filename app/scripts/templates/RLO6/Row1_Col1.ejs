      The term <strong>incident photon</strong> refers to the incoming X-ray particle.
      X-rays photons can have a wide range of energies, 
      similar to the way in which light can have a range of colors.
      A single X-ray photon has a specific energy, given by E = hf, 
      where h is Planck's constant, and f is the frequency of oscillation.
      The frequency of X-ray photons is far higher than that of visible light photons.
