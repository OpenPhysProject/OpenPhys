  This level (Level 10)contains basic information about <strong>Compton X-Ray Scattering</strong>,  
  also known as the <strong>Compton Effect</strong>.  
  The concept of the <strong>photon</strong> is also introduced.

<strong>X-rays</strong> are a high energy form of radiation, 
    similar to light but lying beyond ultraviolet (UV) in the electromagnetic spectrum.
    X-rays are highly penetrating and can break chemical bonds, and so are potentially hazardous.
    <strong>Scattering</strong> means that X-rays encountering an object
    are redirected.
    In Compton X-ray Scattering, the X-rays lose large amounts of energy in the process.
    In <strong>radiotherapy</strong> this energy is used to kill tumors.
