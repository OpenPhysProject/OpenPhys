This level contains basic information about the Compton Effect.  
<br/><br/>
   An X-ray is a high energy form of radiation, 
    similar to light but lying beyond UV (ultraviolet) in the spectrum.
    X-rays are highly penetrating and can break chemical bonds, and so are potentially hazardous.
    <strong>Scattering</strong> means that X-rays aimed at an object
    exit in a different direction than they entered.
    In Compton scattering X-rays are scattered in this way, but lose large amounts of energy in the process.
    In the case of radiotherapy this energy is used to kill tumors.
