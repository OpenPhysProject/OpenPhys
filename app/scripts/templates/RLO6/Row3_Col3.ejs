  Even for single-energy incident photons, the scattered photons vary in both
number and energy as a function of scattering angle.
<br/><br/>
For a spread of incident photon energies, this angular distribution becomes more complex. 
Into any given scattering angle there are now a spectrum of possible energies,
depending on the incidence photon energy.
