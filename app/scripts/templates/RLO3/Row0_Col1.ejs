  The equation E=mc<sup>2</sup> relates these three quantities:
<ul>
    <li>E = Energy (Joules)</li>
    <li>m = Mass (kg)</li>
    <li>c = speed of light in vacuum, which is a constant = 3 x 10<sup>8</sup> meters/sec.</li>
</ul>

In different units, the speed of light is: 3 x 10<sup>8</sup> m/s = 300,000,000 m/s = 300,000 km/s. 
A high velocity bullet leaves the gun at a speed of approximately 1 km/s, 
therefore light is 300 thousand times faster than a speeding bullet.

c<sup>2</sup> means c times c, so the speed of light squared,  
c<sup>2</sup>  = c x c = (3 x 10<sup>8</sup>)  x (3 x 10<sup>8</sup>) = 9 x 10<sup>16</sup>  (m/s)<sup>2</sup>
