    <div class="lesson-content-body">
        The concept of an atom is so central because so much flows from it:
        <ul>
            <li>All of <strong>chemistry</strong> is explained in terms of how 
                atoms combine to form molecules</li>
            <li>Chemistry is the basis of <strong>biochemistry</strong>, which 
                is essential for medicine and biology</li>
            <li>Most of <strong>physics</strong> and almost all 
                <strong>technology</strong> is based on the idea of atoms</li>
        </ul>
