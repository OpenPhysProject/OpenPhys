        <strong>Alpha decay</strong> or <strong>disintegration</strong> is governed by the competition between <strong>short 
        range attractive</strong> nuclear forces and <strong>long range repulsive</strong> electric forces, 
        and results an existing part of nucleus being ejected in a probabilistic 
        ‘tunneling’ process, which is a consequence of quantum mechanical uncertainty. 
        To escape, the particle is able to penetrate a nuclear potential barrier which 
        would be classically impenetrable. <strong>Half-lives</strong> vary over a wide range, being 
        inversely related to the energy available for the decay, the <strong>Q-value</strong> (or 
        disintegration energy). For transitions between nuclear ground states:
        <br/><br/>
        Q-value = Mass(Z,N) - Mass(Z-2, N-2) - Mass(&#945;).
        <br/><br/>
        An alpha decay process involves three particles: the parent and daughter 
        nuclides and the alpha particle itself. The excess energy is shared 
        between alpha and daughter, with the alpha taking the larger part as 
        constrained by the conservation of momentum. Alpha radiation is essentially  
        mono-energetic. Across all nuclides, the alpha kinetic energies found 
        range over 3 MeV to 10 MeV.
