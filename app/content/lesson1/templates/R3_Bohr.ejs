            <h3>Quantization</h3>
            Quantum mechanics is the branch of physics needed to describe microscopic bodies 
            such as atoms and molecules, where classical physics failed to do so.
            <br>In 1913 Niels Bohr proposed a classical orbital atomic 
            model, but with an <i>ad hoc</i> non-classical twist - 
            quantization of electron orbital <strong><mark>angular momentum</mark></strong> 
            (↑). This is now known as the 'old' quantum theory. Bohr's model made many correct and useful 
            predictions, but was clearly only a first step. Some of 
            the most useful results from this early quantum theory 
            were:
            <ul>
                <li>Existence of discrete electron energy levels,</li>
                <li>Transitions between levels explain discrete spectra,</li>
                <li>A derivation of the Rydberg formula for spectral lines.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Limitations</h3>
            Nevertheless, there were also clear limitations of Bohr’s
            theory because it was only accurate for single-electron 
            atoms, and it was a semi-classical approach without 
            any explanation of why the quantization idea worked so well.
