                J.J. Thomson discovered the electron in 1897, the first subatomic particle. Following this discovery, 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._J._Thomson" target="_blank"> Thomson</a>
                   proposed a simple atomic model in which <span class="lesson-content-electron">electrons</span> 
                   were embedded in some <span class="lesson-content-proton">positively charged</span> substance.

                 <h3> Limitations</h3>
                 <p>
                This model was abandoned following

                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Rutherford" target="_blank">Rutherford's </a>
                 interpretation of alpha particle scattering experiments,
                which demonstrated the very tight concentration of charge and matter in what became known as the 
                nucleus.

                The key experiment was performed by 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geiger%E2%80%93Marsden_experiment" target="_blank">Geiger and Marsden</a>
                 who bombarded gold foil with alpha particles and observed that some emerged
                at very high scattering angles, indicating the existence of a dense concentration of charge and mass.
