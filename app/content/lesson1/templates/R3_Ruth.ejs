                 <h3> Meet the Nucleus</h3>
                 Rutherford's work made a major contribution by introducing a very small positively charged
                 nucleus at the center of the atom. The 
                 <span class="term" id="term1"> <b> nucleus </b> </span>
                 <div class="definition" id="definition1"><b><i>(Nucleus: object at the center of the atom)</i></b></div>
                 is a region of very high concentration of mass and positive charge.

                 <h3>Limitations</h3>
                 Unfortunately the image of the atom as a mini solar system was fatally flawed, and 
                 no sensible classical model of the atom could be built.

                 According to <strong><mark>classical mechanics</mark></strong>, an object like an electron can only be
                 accommodated as orbiting the nucleus, in the same way that planets orbit the 
                 sun. However according to <strong><mark>classical electromagnetism</mark> </strong>, such orbital electrons 
                 would continuously radiate energy and very rapidly spiral into the nucleus. 
                 There is no solution to this contradiction within the classical framework. The 
                 solar-system model has other limitations, for instance it can not explain a 
                 discrete spectrum. The unfortunate conclusion is that in classical physics is 
                 that stable atoms cannot exist, and the classical world is a world without any understanding of 
                 internal atomic structure.
