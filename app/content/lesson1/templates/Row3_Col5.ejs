         <h3>Matter Waves</h3> 
         In the 1920s <strong><mark>Louis de Broglie</mark></strong> 
         conceived of unifying light and matter by also ascribing wave properties to matter.
         
         He related wavelength <strong><i>λ</i></strong> 
         to particle momentum <strong><i>p</i></strong> 
         using Planck’s constant, <strong><i>h</i></strong>. 
         <div class='lesson-content-equation'>
         <i>p = h/λ</i>
         </div>
        Subsequently, <strong><mark>Erwin Schrodinger</mark></strong> formalized this by finding a wave 
        equation to mathematically describe de Broglie’s waves. 

        These were key steps in 
        the development of <strong><mark>Quantum Mechanics</mark></strong>.
        
        <h3>Atomic Electrons as Standing Waves</h3>     
        The key development of the quantum mechanical atom is that the electrons are described as
        waves, rather than particles.
        Quantum mechanics describes  electrons bound in 
        atoms as <strong><mark>standing wave</mark></strong> (↑) patterns.
        
        However atomic electrons still retain some particle-like properties, most
        importantly they remain countable.
