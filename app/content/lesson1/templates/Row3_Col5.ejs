           In the 1920s de Broglie conceived of unifying light and matter by also describing
        matter as wave-like. He related wavelength λ to momentum: p = h/λ using Planck’s constant, h. 

        Subsequently, Schrodinger formalized this by finding a wave 
        equation to mathematically describe de Broglie’s waves. 

        These were key steps in 
        the development of <strong><mark>Quantum Mechanics</mark></strong>, which describes electrons bound in 
        atoms in <strong><mark>standing wave</mark></strong> (↑) patterns.
