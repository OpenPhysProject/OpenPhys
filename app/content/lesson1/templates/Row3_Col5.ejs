           In the 1920s de Broglie conceived of unifying light and matter by also describing
        matter as wave-like. He related wavelength λ to momentum: p = h/λ using Planck’s constant, h. 

        Subsequently, Schrodinger formalized this by finding a wave 
        equation to mathematically describe de Broglie’s waves. 

        These were key steps in 
        the development of <strong><mark>Quantum Mechanics</mark></strong>, which describes electrons bound in 
        atoms in <strong><mark>standing wave</mark></strong> (↑) patterns.
        
        <h3>Electrons as Waves</h3>
        The key development of the quantum mechanical atom is that the electrons are described as
        waves, rather than particles.
        However, like particles, the number of electrons in an atom are still countable.
