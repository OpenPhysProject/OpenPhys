                <strong><mark>Angular Momentum</mark></strong> is the corresponding concept to linear momentum for 
                rotating objects, and is also a conserved quantity. Angular momentum can be either in the form of an 
                object spinning by itself (spin angular momentum) or alternatively due to rotation about another object.
                In the latter case (orbital angular momentum), there is a central force, such as gravity.

                <br/><br/>
                Angular momentum is also prominent in quantum mechanics. Many fundamental particles, 
                such as the electron, have intrinsic spin angular momentum.
