         <div class="lesson-content-memo"> Atomic electrons are trapped matter waves</div> 
         Electrons in atoms have both particle and wave properties. 
         For atomic electrons, the wave nature dominates.

            <h3>Atomic Electrons as Standing Waves</h3>     
            The key development of the quantum mechanical atom is that although the nucleus can be usefully still thought of as a particle,
            the electrons must be treated as having wave properties.
            Quantum mechanics describes electrons bound in 
            atoms as <strong><mark>standing wave</mark></strong> (â†‘) patterns.
            However atomic electrons still retain some particle-like properties, most
            importantly they remain countable.  
            
               <h3>Trapped Electrons</h3>
             Atomic electrons are fully wave-like.
            The cloud shaped electron patterns arise from trapping a 3D matter wave in a 3D 
            trap, as defined by the electric field of the nucleus.

            Each <strong>orbital</strong> corresponds to an allowed mode for the
            electron wave, as constrained by the electric field of the nucleus.

            The fact that only two electrons (of opposite spin)
            are allowed within each orbital is known as the
            the <mark><strong>Pauli Exclusion Principle</strong></mark>.
            <br/><br/>
            It is incorrect to think of atomic electrons as point particles with defined trajectories. 
            Rather, imagine a diffuse vibrating wave-like cloud.
            Atomic electrons do not have a classical-style kinetic energy 
            (i.e. you cannot use 
            <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>mv<sup>2</sup>
            )
            because there is no definite velocity.
