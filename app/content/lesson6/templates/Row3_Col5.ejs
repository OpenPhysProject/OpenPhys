      <ul>
          <li>Compton is an interaction between a photon and an electron</li>
          <li>Probability of Compton event is almost independent of Z</li>
          <li>Probability of Compton decreases with energy</li>
          <li>In each collision, energy is shared between scattered photon and recoil electron. 
The sharing depends upon incident energy and scattering angle.</li>
          <li>On average, the fraction transferred to KE/collision INCREASES with photon energy</li>
          <li>In soft tissue, Compton process is much more important than other interactions
              in the range 100keV â€¦10 MeV</li>
      </ul>
