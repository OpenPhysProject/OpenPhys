        Similarly to visible light, X-rays can behave both as waves and as particles. 
        Both are forms of <strong>electromagnetic radiation</strong>.
        The word <strong>photon</strong> is used when talking about the particle-like behaviours, 
        so 'X-ray photon' means a particle-like packet of radiation.
        An X-ray beam can be regarded either as a stream of X-ray photons or as a wave.
        To fire multiple photons, click the blue <strong>X-ray source</strong> box in the graphic below, 
        or for single photons click:
        <input type="button" value="Fire X-Ray Photon" class="lesson-content-button">
