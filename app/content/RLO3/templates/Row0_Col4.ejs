A particle of matter in motion has kinetic energy in addition to the rest mass energy.
The motion can be either non-relativistic or relativistic, depending on the velocity.
'Non-relativistic' means that classical formulae can be used.
If gamma (&#947;) is significantly greater than unity, then the motion is termed 'relativistic',
and different formulae must be used.

<ul>
    <li>c = speed of light</li>
    <li>&#946 = v/c</li>
    <li>&#947;=1/Sqrt(1-&#946;<sup>2</sup>) </li>
</ul>
