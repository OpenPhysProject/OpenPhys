        The binding of the protons and neutrons into a nucleus results in a reduction of mass,
        compared to the free, unbound particles.
        Â 
        Splitting a bound state releases this energy, as occurs in nuclear fission.
        This energy release is the mechanism behind nuclear power and nuclear weapons.
