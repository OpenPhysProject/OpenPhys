        The probability of a pair production event depends upon the energy of the incident photon.
        <br/>
        The cross-section mis zero below the threshold, but increases rapidly above 1.022 MeV.  
        For pair-production, the cross-section increases with energy.
        This means that, for the pair production process, a high energy X-ray beam is LESS penetrating! 
        This is the opposite behaviour from photo-electric and Compton!
