             This module is about the photoelectric effect, 
             also known as photoelectric absorption. 
             We will use the abbreviation: 
             <strong><mark>PE = PhotoElectric</mark></strong>.
             
             The PE effect is an interaction between a photon and an atom 
             (or if you prefer between a photon and a bound electron).
             The effect is well-named because an incident photon produces an electron (photo --> electric).
             
             
             The main features are:
             <ol>
                 <li>photon-induced <strong><mark>ionization</mark></strong> of an atom</li>
                 <li>photon <strong><mark>absorption</mark></strong></li>
                 <li><strong><mark>photoelectron</mark></strong>production</li>
             </ol>
            
              Three different scenarios are covered (see below).
              We will focus on applications in medical physics.

              <strong>RADIOLOGY:</strong> The PE effect is of major importance in
              X-ray imaging because it is the cause of the clear image contrast
              between bone and the soft tissues.           
              <br/><br/>
              <strong>RADIOTHERAPY:</strong> The PE effect is also important in 
              radiation therapy, especially for lower energy treatments such as orthovoltage.
