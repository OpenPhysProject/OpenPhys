The basic NMR experiment (‘pulse sequence’) is: <br/>
(1) Magnetize the patient (i.e. put inside a magnet) <br/>
(2) Transmit RF pulse at the Larmor frequency (high power) <br/>
(3) Detect a (very weak) RF signal with the receiver coil.  <br/>
(4) Wait (timing can affect different signal strengths) <br/>
(5) Repeat from step 2.
<br/><br/>
<h3>	FID (Free Induction Decay) = NMR Signal</h3>
	The weak RF signal from the sample is called the FID (pronounced eff-eye-dee). This is the simplest type of NMR signal.
<br/><br/>
<h3>	Signal Averaging and TR</h3>
	It is common to repeat the experiment, adding up the FIDs to reduce the effects of random noise.
	This is necessary because the signal is very weak.
	The repeat period is called TR (Repetition Time). Most MRI sequences have a TR.
<br/><br/>
<h3>	In Phase</h3>
When the longitudinal magnetization, $M_z$, gets converted into the transverse magnetization ($M_{xy}$) as a result of applying an RF pulse, the individual spins in the sample are initially in phase (coherent).
The RF pulse is high power and can heat the patient, so safety rules apply.
<br/><br/>
<h3>	Drifting out of Phase</h3>
After some time, the NMR signal that was generated by the RF pulse begins to decay (exponentially) due to the individual spins losing phase coherence with each other. This process is known as a free induction decay (FID).
