The basic NMR experiment (‘pulse sequence’) is:
1. Magnetize the patient (i.e. put inside a magnet)
2. Transmit RF pulse at the Larmor frequency (high power can heat the patient so there are limits)
3. Detect (very weak) RF signal with the receiver coil. This RF signal is called an NMR signal.
4. Wait (timing can affect different signal strengths)
5. Repeat from step 2.
               <br/><br/>
When the longitudinal magnetization, $M_z$, gets converted into the transverse magnetization ($M_{xy}$) as a result of applying an RF pulse, the individual spins in the sample are initially in phase coherence.
After some time, the NMR signal that was generated by the RF pulse begins to decay (exponentially) due to the individual spins losing phase coherence with each other. This process is known as a free induction decay (FID).
