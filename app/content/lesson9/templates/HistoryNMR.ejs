NMR was originally discovered in 1938 by Isaac Rabi (awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1944) using a molecular beam in a vacuum chamber. However, it wasn't until 1945 that NMR was demonstrated in matter by Edward Purcell and Felix Bloch both independently and at the same time. They were awarded a joint Nobel Prize in Physics in 1952.
Over the years, a number of techniques have been developed that rely on the phenomenon of NMR. The term "NMR spectroscopy" may ring a bell in your head from your high-school chemistry class, or in your post-secondary studies, but it is an important technique used by chemists to analyze chemical properties of a sample. NMR spectroscopy came about in 1950. Another technique that arose approximately 30 years after NMR is Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) which applies the same principle to produce an image. MR Imaging was originally known as `NMR Imaging'.
