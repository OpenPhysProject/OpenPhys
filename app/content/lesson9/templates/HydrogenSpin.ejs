	Your body is composed mostly of water and fat. Thus, medical imaging by MRI exploits this phenomenon and is based on NMR of hydrogen nuclei in the body.
      Hydrogen, because it only has 1 proton and therefore an odd mass number, has an associated magnetic moment and a proton spin of 1/2.
               <br/><br/>
      At 1 Tesla (T), hydrogen has a resonance frequency of 42.57 MHz. This means that if an external RF pulse of 42.57 MHz is applied at 1 T, then 1H will become excited and we would be able to detect a signal. This resonance frequency value is specific only to hydrogen so if a 50 MHz pulse was applied to hydrogen at 1T, then we wouldn't be able to detect a signal.
      Other nuclei of different atoms and isotopes have their own resonant frequency.
