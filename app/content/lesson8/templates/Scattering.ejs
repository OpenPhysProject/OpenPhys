                atomic theory:
                <br/>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pure elements consist of atoms</li>
                    <li>The atoms of a specific element are identical</li>
                    <li>Atoms cannot be sub-divided</li>
                    <li>Atoms of different elements differ in atomic weight</li>
                    <li>Atoms unite to form chemical compounds</li>
                    <li>Atoms cannot be created or destroyed by chemical reactions</li>             
                </ol> 

               In 1808 Dalton published <em><i>A New System of Chemical Philosophy</i></em>.
               He was also known for studying colour-blindness.

               <h3>Limitations</h3>
               Although Daltonâ€™s atomic theory helped build the foundation of our understanding in atoms, 
               the majority of his points were later discovered to be wrong:
               <br>2. Isotopes are different versions of the same element. 
               Although the same element must have the same number of protons, 
               they can differ in number of neutrons. 
               The same element can also differ in number of electrons, providing different charges.
               <br>3. The atom is divisible into smaller particles, such as neutrons, protons and electrons.
               <br>6. Through nuclear fission, atoms can be destroyed.
               Through nuclear fusion, atoms can be created.
