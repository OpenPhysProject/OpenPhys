                Beam behavior is the sum of particle behavior. 
                Particles have various properties including identity, flow, energy and penetration ability. 
                If there is a range of particles, the beam will have an energy spectrum.
                The deposition of energy tissue is dose (J/kg).
                <br>Beam quality is a term referring to the penetration ability of a beam.
                The type and energies of particles affect beam quality. 
                <br>Filtration affects beam quality, as does beam hardening (in which the 2nd half-value-layer is longer than the first).
                Beams can also be contaminated with unwanted particles, with adverse effects on the quality.
                <br>Charged particle beams (electrons, protons, heavy ions) are directly ionizing. Energy is lost in a large number of small increments. 
                Electrons scatter easily, so do not travel in straight rays either through air or in tissue.
                On the other hand, uncharged photons and neutrons are indirectly ionizing.
                X-ray or gamma ray photons in a beam can be assumed to travel in a straight line until absorbed.
