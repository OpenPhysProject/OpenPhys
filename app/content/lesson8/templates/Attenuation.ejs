                   Attenuation is the reduction in beam intensity, 
                   or the decrease in the number of photons, due to by the interaction of photons and atoms of material 
                   it passes through.
                   Attenuation is caused by:
                   <ol>
                       <li><strong>distance</strong> from the source</li>
                       <li><strong>absorption</strong> </li>
                       <li><strong>scattering</strong></li>
                       
                   </ol>
                   
                   The photoelectric effect is the main attenuation process at low photon energies. 
                   Pair production is the main attenuation process is the main attenuation process at very high photon energies.
