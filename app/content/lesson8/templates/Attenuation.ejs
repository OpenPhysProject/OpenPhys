                   This lesson concerns diagnostic and therapeutic X-ray beams in the body. 
                   It is assumed the beam emerges from a <strong>point source</strong>.
                   <br/><br/>
                   Beam attenuation is the reduction in beam intensity per cross sectional beam area.
                   This may also be thought of in terms of the energy or number of photons
                   that the beam contains (per cross-sectional area).
                   Attenuation is caused by:
                   <ol>
                       <li><strong>distance</strong> from the source</li>
                       <li><strong>absorption</strong> processes </li>
                       <li><strong>scattering</strong> processes</li>
                       
                   </ol>
                   
                   Photoelectric absorption is the main attenuation process at low photon energies. 
                   Electron-positron pair production is the main attenuation process at very high photon energies.
