                HVL (Half-Value Layer) describes the beam directly in terms of penetration ability.
                HVL is the thickness of a <strong>specified absorber</strong> required to attenuate the intensity of the beam to half its original value.
                This is often an idealization. The HVL can vary for several reason, so that HVL2 > HVL1. 
                The HVL must always be the HVL of a specified material. HVL is defined by measurement.
                <br>In RT the penetrating ability is key issue in calculating dose (dosimetry), so this is an appropriate way to describe a treatment beam. 
                HVL is also important in shielding calculations for radiation safety.
                <br>HVL = 0.693/&mu;
                <br>Where &mu; is the linear attenuation constant.
