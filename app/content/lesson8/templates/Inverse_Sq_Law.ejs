            Given a point radiation source, the radiation's intensity at any distance away is 
            inversely proportional to the square of the distance, mathematically given by:
            <strong>
                Intensity &prop; 1/Distance<sup>2</sup> 
            </strong>.
            <br/>
            The origin of the law is that as radiation from a point travels outwards,
            it spreads out onto the surface of larger and larger (imaginary) spheres.
            As you recall, the surface area of a sphere is 4 pi r<sup>2</sup>.
            So this is why the intensity has to drop in proportion to 1/r<sup>2</sup>.
            

            <br/><br/>
            <strong>Using the Formula</strong><br/>
                CAREFUL: One slight trick with this formula is that you can't put in r=0. 
                You can use the formula as follows, where we consider the intensity of the radiation
                at two different distances from the source (k is some constant): <br/>
                <strong>
                I<sub>1</sub> = k/r<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>  <br/>       
                I<sub>2</sub> = k/r<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>
                </strong><br/>
                So we can eliminate <strong>k</strong>: <br/>
                  <strong>
                I<sub>1</sub>r<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> =        
                I<sub>2</sub>r<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> = k
                </strong>  <br/>
                We can rearrange this: <br/>
                <strong>
                I<sub>1</sub>/I<sub>2</sub> = 
                r<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> /        
                r<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> 
                </strong>  <br/>    
                <br/>
                TIP: always check that the intensity you calculate is lower further away from the source.
