We learned previously that protons precess around the magnetic field lines with an angular frequency ($\omega$) proportional to the magnetic field strength, $B$. This is the Larmor equation: $\omega = \gamma B$.
For static $B_0$, the precession frequency becomes:
$$\omega_0 = \gamma B_0 \quad {\rm (1)}$$
For a rotating frame during a square pulse, with amplitude $B_1$, the nutation frequency becomes:
$$\omega_1 = \gamma B_1 \quad {\rm (2)}$$
The difference between equations (1) and (2) is that (1) is for free precession whereas (2) is specific to the square pulse. So, the spins come down at a certain frequency, $\omega_1$. Given that the flip angle for a square pulse is: $$\phi = \omega_1 t_p \quad {\rm (3)}$$
we can combine the two equations (2) $\&$ (3) to make:
$$\phi = \omega_1 t_p = \gamma B_1 t_p$$
where $t_p$ is the pulse length and $B_1$ is the amplitude of the pulse.
