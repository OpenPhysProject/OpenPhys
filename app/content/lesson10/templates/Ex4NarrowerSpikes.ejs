Simply adding sine and cosine does not make a spike -- the process is a lot more complicated than that. A single spike is the $FT$ of sin and cos -- NOT addition.
A sharp edge/spike, then, gives oscillations as shown in the figure below. Furthermore, if we have time spikes that are spaced very closely together, applying a FT would produce stretched oscillations  -- and vice-versa. As you may have noticed, the principle of narrow $\rightarrow$ wide and vice-versa applies not only to top hats but to spikes as well.
