When $B0$ is applied to a sample, magnetization $M$ is produced. Magnetization results from the alignment of the
hydrogen spins with $B0$. It can be calculated by the following formula:
$$M = \# \ aligned \ magnets/volume$$
Magnetization can also be increased by increasing the magnetic field strength:
$$ M = \gamma^2 h^2 B_0 n I (I+1)/3 k T $$
where $\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio (units: MHz/tesla) and is different for each nuclei, $h$ = Planck's constant (units: $J \times s$), $n$ = number of spins/unit volume, $k$ = Boltzmann's constant, and $T$ = temperature (Kelvin). As shown in the above equation, $M$ would increase if: 1) the magnetic field strength is increased, 2) if the spin number is higher and/or 3) if the temperature of the sample is decreased.
Magnetization has properties, e.g. T1, T2, and others. Even a millimeter cubed of anywhere in our body is not uniform. There are different tissue types, for e.g., it could be half water and half fat although this can't be distinguished in an image. What you do get, rather, is an average tissue density or T1. $M$ is a property of the tissue, so tissue type affects $M$.  Fat and water have different contributions to $M$.
