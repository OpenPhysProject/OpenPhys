When a $B_0$ field is applied to a sample, magnetization $M$ is produced. Magnetization results from the alignment of the
hydrogen spins with $B_0$. It is defined as:
$$M = Magnetic\ Moment\ / \ Volume$$
The magnetization is proportional to the magnetic field strength:
$$ M = \gamma^2 h^2 B_0 n I (I+1)/3 k T $$
where $\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio (units: MHz/Tesla) and is different for each nucleus.
In the formula: $h$ = Planck's constant (units: $J \times s$), $n$ = number of spins/unit volume, $k$ = Boltzmann's constant, and $T$ = temperature (Kelvin).
As shown in the above equation, $M$ increases if: 1) the magnetic field strength is increased, 2) if the spin number is higher and/or 3) if the temperature of the sample is decreased.

<h3>	Tissue Magnetization</h3>
In MRI, it is the tissue of the body that becomes magnetized.
$M$ is therefore a property of the tissue, and the tissue type affects $M$.
The magnetization has various properties, e.g. T1, T2, and others.
The body is complex.
Even a millimeter cube of tissue in our body is not necessarily uniform.
A pixel might be be $50\%$ water and $50\%$ fat, which have different magnetic properties.
This often cannot be distinguished, so the pixel intensity is often a weighted average.
