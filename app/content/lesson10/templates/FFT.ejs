Since the 1940s/50s, the terms FT and FFT are interchangeable. However, if you're $really$ curious, the difference between Fourier transform (FT) and Fast Fourier transform (FFT) is that the former (FT) is a function while the latter (FFT) is an algorithm. FFT was invented to compute calculations of the functions in a FT quickly.
