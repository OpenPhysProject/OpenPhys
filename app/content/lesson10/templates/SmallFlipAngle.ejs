	 The advantage of using a small flip angle (e.g.$<$90$^\circ$) in imaging is that we can get a decent amount of signal but still have some magnetization left over in the z-axis for next time. In other words, we wouldn't have to wait as long for the magnetization to recover compared to using a 90$^\circ$ flip angle. TR is shorter so image acquisition is faster.
