A spin echo is when the spins come together again. It is generated by two RF pulses consecutively, usually a $90^{\circ}$ followed by $180^{\circ}$ pulse (see figure). The purpose of the second pulse is to regenerate or recover the signal that decayed during the free induction decay (FID). This is also known as a $180^{\circ}$ refocusing pulse. The echo time (TE) is the duration between the midpoint of first ($90^{\circ}$) pulse and the maximum amplitude of the spin echo. The time between the two pulses equates to half the echo time.
