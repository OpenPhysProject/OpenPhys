The Fourier Transform is linear. The FT of a sum is equal to the sum of the FTs:
$$FT(f_1 + f_2) = FT(f_1) + FT(f_2)$$
In other words, if you add two functions together and Fourier transform them, it would be the same as Fourier transforming each of the functions separately and then adding them.
Linearity has the properties of additivity and homogeneity. Additivity is the concept explained above. Homogeneity means if we increase a signal input by a certain amount, then the signal output will be increased by that same amount. For example, doubling the input strength will double the output strength.
