A $180^{\circ}$ inversion pulse, also known as a $\pi$ pulse, inverts $M_Z$. The figure shows what happens to $M_Z$ after a $180^{\circ}$ RF pulse is applied: Net $M_Z$ is initially at equilibrium (=1; +z-axis) but then becomes rotated $180^{\circ}$ by the pulse to -1, or -z-axis. Then, it recovers back to equilibrium with a T1 relaxation time. Note that it $inverts$, so if the net magnetization was initially negative, it will become positive after the inversion pulse. This type of pulse is important for measuring T1 or/and creating T1 contrast. Another function of this pulse is that it can be used to selectively eliminate a signal with a specific T1. For example, FLAIR eliminates the fluid signal. So you would get a null signal (more on FLAIR in the subsequent pages).
