 When a patient is exposed to an external main (static) magnetic field, $B_0$, they become magnetized, producing a net nuclear magnetization in the same direction as $B_0$.
 However, when a radio-frequency (RF) field, $B_1$, is applied perpendicular to $B_0$, the spins will start to $precess$ around the magnetic field lines. Precession can be illustrated by a spinning top. If we touch, hit it, or let gravity simply do its work, the spinning top performs a wobbling type of motion. Protons in a magnetic field also show this type of motion, called precession. The RF field applies a torque on the net magnetization, causing it to rotate from the longitudinal direction $M_z$ (same direction as $B_0$) into the transverse plane, $M_{xy}$. Protons precess around the magnetic field lines with an angular frequency ($\omega$) that is proportional to the magnetic field strength, $B$. This relationship is mathematically represented by the Larmor equation:
  $$ \omega_0 = \gamma B_0 = 2 \pi f $$ where $B_0$ = main magnetic field and $\gamma$ = gyromagnetic ratio (units: MHz/tesla). The gyromagnetic ratio is different for different nuclei.
  As you can see, the stronger the magnetic field, the higher the precession frequency.
