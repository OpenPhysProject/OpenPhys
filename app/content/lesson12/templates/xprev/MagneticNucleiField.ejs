 Like an atom, the nucleus has discrete energy levels (which are very close to one another, so $\Delta Energy = hf$ is small - in the radiofrequency range of the EM spectrum). require complicated mathematical calculations in order to be able to analyze all of the interactions between the nucleons and determine their properties. Thus, several nuclear models have been developed to simplify these calculations e.g. the Shell Model; the Collective Model.

Hydrogen nuclei behave like little magnets that are normally aligned in a random fashion. However, when exposed to a strong external magnetic field, B, they will align parallel (pointing up) to the external field or anti-parallel(pointing down). Nuclei that are aligned parallel exhibit lower energy, and thereful are more stable than those that are aligned anti-parallel, which contain higher energy and are less stable. The protons are not static but precess around the magnetic field lines, and the stronger the magnetic field, the higher the precession frequency. This relationship is mathematically represented by the Larmor equation:
$$ 2 \pi f = \omega = \gamma B $$
               <br/><br/>
	For a current loop, the magnitude of the magnetic dipole moment is given by the  product of the current loop and itâ€™s area, $\mu = IA$, where {\it I} = current, {\it A} = area.
               <br/><br/>
	Note that for a nucleus in a magnetic field, {\it $B_0$}, there is no resonant frequency and therefore, no precession. The nucleus only becomes magnetized.
