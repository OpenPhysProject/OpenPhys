The basic NMR experiment (‘pulse sequence’) is: <br/>
(1) Magnetize the patient (i.e. put inside a magnet) <br/>
(2) Transmit RF pulse at the Larmor frequency (high power <br/>
(3) Detect a (very weak) RF signal with the receiver coil. (`NMR Signal' or $Free\ Induction\ Decay\ (FID)$.  <br/>
(4) Wait (timing can affect different signal strengths) <br/>
(5) Repeat from step 2.<br/>
<br/><br/>
<h3>	In Phase</h3>
When the longitudinal magnetization, $M_z$, gets converted into the transverse magnetization ($M_{xy}$) as a result of applying an RF pulse, the individual spins in the sample are initially in phase (coherent).
The RF pulse is high power and can heat the patient, so safety rules apply.
<br/><br/>
<h3>	Drifting out of Phase</h3>
After some time, the NMR signal that was generated by the RF pulse begins to decay (exponentially) due to the individual spins losing phase coherence with each other. This process is known as a free induction decay (FID).
