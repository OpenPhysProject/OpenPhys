   In the 1920s de Broglie conceived of unifying light and matter by also describing
matter as wave-like. He related wavelength λ to momentum: p = h/λ using Planck’s constant, h. 
    
Subsequently, Schrodinger formalized this by finding a wave 
equation to mathematically describe de Broglie’s waves. 
    
These were key steps in 
the development of <strong>Quantum Mechanics</strong>, which describes electrons bound in 
atoms in <strong>standing wave</strong> (↑) patterns.
