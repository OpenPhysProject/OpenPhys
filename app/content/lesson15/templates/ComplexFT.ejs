A complex function consists of both real and imaginary parts.
The figure shows a complex signal from the time domain (LEFT panels)  being converted to the frequency domain (MIDDLE panels),
through a fast Fourier transform.
<br/><br/>
<h3>	Magnitude and Phase</h3>
These real and imaginary parts can also be displayed as magnitude (top right panel) and phase (bottom right panel).
The magnitude function is the absolute value of the two parts at each frequency.
The FFT also provides us with the phase of each frequency.
<br/><br/>
<h3>	Representations</h3>
Information in each column is interchangeable with each other.
In other words, they are different representations of the same information.
A single real number cannot represent these two properties, but a complex number can.
Thus, using complex numbers in the FFT will give us an imaginary part or equivalently, the phase information.
