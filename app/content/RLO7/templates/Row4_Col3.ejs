The cross-section, Îº, is zero below the threshold, but increases rapidly above 1.022 MeV.  
For pair-production, the cross-section increases with energy.
This means that, for the pair production process, a high energy X-ray beam is LESS penetrating! 
This is the opposite behaviour from photo-electric and Compton!
