        A nuclide is any atomic nucleus with a specific number of protons (Z) and neutrons (N).
        The total number of nucleons is given by the mass number A = Z + N.
        There are over 3000 different nuclides, roughly 90% of which are unstable, i.e. radiaoctive.
        <br>Because the same elements have the same atomic number, elements are commonly written without specifying atomic number, 
        and only mass number (A) is specified.
