        <strong>Identity</strong><br/>
        Alpha particles are high speed <strong>helium-4 nuclei</strong> (Z=2, N=2) with 
        kinetic energies, which depend upon the parent nucleus, in the range 3 MeV to 10 MeV, and velocities around 
        1/20<sup>th</sup> the speed of light.  
        Alpha particle mass is 4.00140 amu. 
        The helium-4 nuclide is particularly stable and forms readily.

        <strong>Discovery</strong><br/>
        Ernest Rutherford on his investigations into the radiation 
        produced by samples of uranium: 
        <br/>
        <i>“These experiments show that uranium radiation is complex, and that 
        there are present at least two types of radiation - one that is very 
        readily absorbed, which will be termed for convenience the &#945; 
        radiation, and the other of a more penetrative character, which will be 
        termed the &#946; radiation.”</i> <strong> ‘Uranium Radiation and the 
        Electrical Conduction produced by it.’ E. Rutherford, (Philosophical 
        Magazine Series 5 (47) Issue 284, 1899).</strong>

        <strong>Radiation Characteristics</strong><br/>
        Alpha radiation is a densely ionizing, but short range form of charged 
        particle radiation.
        Although of <strong>short range</strong> (few cm in air), alpha particles deposits a 
        large amount of energy for each millimeter of travel. This property of dense energy deposition
        is termed high 
        <strong>Linear Energy Transfer (LET)</strong> radiation. 
        The dense ionization produced is very damaging to cells, 
        but due to the very short range &#945; emitters are only hazardous if ingested or 
        inhaled (e.g. radon).
        
        <br/><br/>
        <strong>Source nuclides and n/p ratio</strong><br/>
        Alpha radiation is generated by heavy radioactive elements with low neutron/proton 
        ratios (n/p ratio), such as radon, radium, uranium and plutonium.
        A low n/p ratio indicates that there are not enough neutrons to sufficiently stabilize the nucleus.
