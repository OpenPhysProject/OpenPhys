    If a nucleus has excess energy (i.e. is not in its <strong>ground state</strong>) 
    it can decay by just shedding energy, without any change in composition. As 
    described in the nuclear <strong>shell model</strong>, a nuclide has specific 
    excited energy levels – just as bound electrons in atoms do – but at much 
    higher energy levels. These excited nuclear states often arise as a consequence 
    of a previous radioactive decay or particle bombardment. Excited nuclear states 
    usually decay very quickly, but the few longer-lived states are known as 
    <strong>metastable isomers</strong> (e.g. the medically important Tc99m) and 
    their decays as <strong>isomeric transitions (IT)</strong>. Both categories 
    of energy-loss decay can happen in one of two ways: a) emission of a 
    <strong>gamma ray</strong> photon, or b) <strong>internal conversion (IC)</strong>. 
    In the latter an orbital electron carries the excess nuclear energy away, 
    leaving an orbital hole (which is subsequently filled).
