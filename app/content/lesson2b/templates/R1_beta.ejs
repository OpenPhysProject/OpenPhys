        Beta radiation is a medium-range form of charged particle ionizing 
                radiation generated by radioactive elements with low neutron/proton ratios. 
                Cobalt decays to nickel by beta-minus decay:

        Beta-minus (&#946;-) particles are <strong>high energy electrons</strong>, which can usually be 
        stopped by a few millimeters of aluminum. Beta radiation inherently has a <strong>broad 
        energy spectrum</strong> because energy is shared between the beta particle and 
        a co-created anti-neutrino. Neutrinos are extremey difficult to detect so 
        have no biological impact. Because of their charge and motion, beta particles are 
        affected by electric and magnetic fields. 
        Beta radiation may be used for autoradiography due to the short range. 
        &#946;- are created in (and 
        rapidly ejected from) nuclei with <strong>high n/p ratios</strong> by conversion of a 
        neutron into a proton.
