        A piece of radioactive material (containing a population of radionuclides) can be 
        described by the amount of radiation it produces.
        <strong>Activity</strong> refers to the number of decays per second for a given sample.
        The SI unit for activity is the <strong>Becquerel (Bq)</strong>. 
        An older unit is the<strong> Curie</strong>, 
        which is the activity of approximately 1 gram of radium. 
        The <strong>specific activity</strong> is the activity per unit mass (e.g. Bq/gram or Ci/gram).
        
        <ul style="list-style-type:none">
            <li> 1 Bq = 1 decay / sec = 1 dps </li>
            <li> 1 Curie = 3.7 x 10<sup>10</sup> Bq = 37 GBq </li>
        </ul>

        Activity (A) of a sample is given by <strong>λN</strong>, 
        where <strong>λ</strong> is the <strong>decay constant</strong>
        and <strong>N</strong> the number of nuclides.
        Activity decreases exponentially with time (t), according to A = A<sub>0</sub>e<sup>-λt</sup>, 
        where A<sub>0</sub> is the initial activity.
        
        The <strong>half-life</strong> (T<sub>1/2</sub>) of a nuclide is the time it takes for activity to fall to 50%, 
        which is also the time for half the nuclei to decay. 
        This can vary from billions of years (e.g. 238-U 4.468 billion years) to a tiny fraction of a second. 
       
         <ul style="list-style-type:none">
            <li> A = λ N </li>
            <li> A = A<sub>0</sub>e<sup>-λt</sup> </li>
            <li> T<sub>1/2</sub> = log<sub>e</sub>(2)/λ =~ 0.693/λ </li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Radioactive Equilibrium</strong> can occur if the daughter half-life is shorter than the parent.
        <strong>Transient equilibrium</strong> occurs if the daughter's half-life is not much longer, 
        such as Molybdenum-99 (67 hr) to Technetium-99m (6 hr). 
        <strong>Secular equilibrium</strong> occurs if the daughter T<sub>1/2</sub> is much shorter, 
        such as Radium-226 (1600 years, α) to Radon-222 (3.82 days, α).
