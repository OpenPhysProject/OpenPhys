        <div class="lesson-content-memo">The nucleus sleeps at the heart of the atom. The comings and goings 
            of electrons do not disturb its slumber.</div>
        
        Although <strong>Z</strong> and <strong>A</strong> determine basic atomic 
        physical and chemical properties, details of internal nuclear structure 
        do not affect chemical processes. Externally, the nucleus 
        exhibits a handful of fixed properties: <strong>mass, angular momentum, 
        electric charge, magnetic dipole</strong>, and <strong>electric quadrupole moment</strong>. 
        
        The nuclear energy levels are quite inaccessible to chemical or 
        thermal processes, so the nucleus 
        remains dormant in its <strong>ground state</strong>. This dissociation 
        between the nuclear and electronic structures explains alchemists' 
        failure to achieve transmutation of elements by chemical means.

        But, if the sleeper awakes, great powers are unleashed and destruction is spread abroad.
