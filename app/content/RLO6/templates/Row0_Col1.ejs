        Similarly to visible light, X-rays can behave both as waves and as particles. 
    Both are forms of <strong>electromagnetic radiation</strong>.
    The word <strong>photon</strong> is used when talking about the particle-like behaviours, 
    so 'X-ray photon' means a particle-like packet of radiation.
    An X-ray beam can be regarded either as a stream of X-ray photons or as a wave.
