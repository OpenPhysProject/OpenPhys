### Plan Your New Lesson
Plan your lesson to map it to pages in a 2D grid layout (see working examples 
on http://openphys.med.ualberta.ca/).  
Moving to the right in the 2D grid is intended to be progress through a lesson.  
Moving down in the 2D grid is intended to represent more difficult concepts that are related to the pages above.  
Moving up in the 2D grid is intended to relay less difficult concepts that are related to the lesson below.  
There should be one main horizontal grouping of pages (primary path) that is meant to be the focus of the lesson.  
There can be horizontal gaps between pages in the 2D grid.  
There can be as much or as little content as you want, but consider that a very large 2D map may be overwhelming to new users and be difficult 
to use.  In these cases it might be better to break content into smaller groups.  
For each page in the 2D map, write the text and collect any other assets (ie images) that will exist on that page.  
Repeat this process for each lesson you want to create.
