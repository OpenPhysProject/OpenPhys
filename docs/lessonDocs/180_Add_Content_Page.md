### Add a Content Page
Each content page uses a separate file. 
These files are called *template files* and have the file extension .ejs.
They are actually html files.

#### 1) Create a new template file  
This requires a title and at least some text.

##### Lesson Styles
There are default styles set for all elements on the page. 
To use these just copy from another template file, replacing only the lesson content.  


#### 2) Create an entry in data.js 
Each lesson has a *data.js* file.
This file contains the map layout information.
