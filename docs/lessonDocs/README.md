### lessonDocs
These *lessonDocs* describe how to add new lesson content to an existing OpenMap site.

#### Prerequisites
1. The content from the author.  
2. The map layout of pages from the author.

#### Lesson File Organization
All information for each lesson is contained within a single folder, with sub-folders.  

  
1. Each content page has a single file for text: (MyPage.ejs)  
2. Images used in a lesson are all in the *assets* subfolder.  
3. If there is animation, then this code is in a separate file: (MyPage.js). 
These files are in the *views* sub-folder. 
4. The whole lesson map layout is in one file: (data.js)
