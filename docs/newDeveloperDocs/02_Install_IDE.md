### Install IDE  
In order to easily work with the files in the project, you need to install 
a tool for editing code (IDE). 
We use Netbeans, a powerful file editor for web development.  
Netbeans works well with javascript, html, and css (scss).  

#### Prerequisites
Admin access to your own computer.
