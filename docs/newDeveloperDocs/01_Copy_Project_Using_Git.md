### Copy Project Using Git

#### git, github, and SourceTree
Git is a source code management system, what you install is software that understands how 
to work with git code stores (repositories). A GUI for using your local git can be useful 
(we use SourceTree). Github is a cloud service for git repositories, often used to share 
opensource projects. When using git you have a local copy of the entire project on your 
machine (clone), and as you make changes you copy (push) them to the online repository. 
When others make changes to the online repository, you copy them to yours (pull). You also 
clone a repository when you want to make a different site based off of it (fork).

#### pushing changes
Before you can push changes to a repository, you need to be granted access to the project. 
You will need to [create an account on github](https://github.com/join) and share the name with a project owner / 
administrator so they can grant you access.

#### Prerequisites
