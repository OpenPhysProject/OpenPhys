### Naming
This is a high level overview of the naming to help you find the related files.  

The first page you see is called the lesson tile view, meaning the related files are all 
named with LessonTile except for main.js which controls a lot of this fist views behavior.  
The page you see after clicking a tile is called the map view.  
The page you see after clicking one of the cards in the map view is a combination 
of the lesson base view (which contains all the elements and behaviors common to 
all content) and the content view which contains the specific lesson content related to 
that card (these are templates loaded from the content folder).
