### Copy Site Code
Download the files (“Clone” OpenPhys Repository)  

All the files needed are freely available on the internet. 
They are stored at ‘github’ which is a popular website used for archiving open source software projects. 
For your own website you will need to copy (‘clone’) the OpenPhys files (repository) to create your own project. Once you have your own version you can make any changes you need.

If you have an IT department, they can do this step for you.  
If not, you will need to become familiar with git and github.  
Luckily, github includes some easy to follow steps at [https://github.com/](https://github.com/) to help you get started. 
When ready, copy the OpenPhys files (clone [https://github.com/OpenPhysProject/OpenPhys.git](https://github.com/OpenPhysProject/OpenPhys.git))
 as a base for your own project (repository).  

Instructions on cloning a repository can be found at
