### Google Analytics
OpenPhys includes google analytics in index.html.  You will need to remove it or 
replace the GA code with your own.

#### Steps:
1. Find line 102 in Index.html (starts with comment <!-- Google Analytics: change UA-XXXXX-X to be your site's ID. -->)
2. If you don't want GA, remove the entire section (everything in <script>)
3. If you have your own, change UA-XXXXX-X to be your site's ID
4. Learn how to setup and use Google Analytics [here](https://developers.google.com/analytics/).
