## Guide for Authors: How to add content to an OpenMap Website

### Definitions:
Author: Person who write the lessons  
Content: text, pictures, quizzes etc.

### Tutorial
For this tutorial, we will assume that:   
1. You are the author and want to add new content (or modify existing content).   
2. your website has been set up (typically done by IT staff),   
3. You have a team member who will upload your content to the website. This process is explained in a different docuemnt.

#### Step 1: Create the Content for a Lesson
You may already have this content from teaching a course.

#### Step 2: Organize the content into pages
An OpenMap website consist of a series of pages.  
You need to arrange your content into this format. 
For instance, each page in a Microsoft word document may correspond to a single website page.
You can always rearrange later, but it is preferable to think out the organization first to save effort.

#### Step 3: Design the Map
The pages are arranged into a 2D map, so you need to design this layout.

#### Step 4: Create the Text Files
The website cannot use (e.g.) Microsoft word files directly, so your content needs to be copy and pasted
into a textfile. Images are copied as separate files. 
The best way to do this is to find an example file that is similar the style that you want, then just
replace the example text with your text.   
You need to use a suitable text editor for this step.  
One recommended one is 'NetBeans', but there are many others. See the separate document on using NetBeans.

#### Step 5: Testing your Content Locally (on your computer)
It is not necessary, but can be convenient to test a demo version of the web site on your own computer, before uploading to the web.
See the instructions on 'running a local webserver'.

#### Step 6: Upload to website
Give your team-member your finished files.
