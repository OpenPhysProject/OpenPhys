### Development Overview (for developers)
OpenPhys is built on current web standards and best practices.  It is a responsive, mobile first web app. 
The goal of this document is to briefly describe the tools used and the project structure.
The project files are stored in a git repository.


#### Git Repository [OJ PLEASE FIX THIS UP. I DONT UNDERSTAND THE GIT/CLONE PROCESS. Does clone come before or after
installation?  

what about user registratino on github?  

please explain outline here, then refer to git docs for details]
All source code is stored in a git repository. In overview these are the steps to set up the repository:  
1. clone  (Clone the [OpenPhys repo](https://github.com/OpenPhysProject/OpenPhys.git).) Learn more about cloning a repo [here](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/).  
2. install git locally  
3. install SourceTree  
4. edit cloned files  


#### Development Tools
You will need the following:

1. An IDE to edit the files. This project was developed with [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/)
2. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed
