## Guide for Authors: How to add content to an OpenMap Website

### Definitions:
Author: Person who write the lessons

Content: text, pictures, quizzes etc.

### Tutorial
For this tutorial, we will assume that : 
1. You are the author and want to add new content (or modify existing content). 
2. your website has been set up (typically done by IT staff), 
3. You have a team member who will upload your content to the website This process is explained in a different docuemnt.

#### Step 1: Create the Content for a Lesson
You may already have this content from teaching a course.

#### Step 2: Organize the content into pages
An OpenMap website consist of a series of pages.  
You need to arrange your content into this format. 
For instance, each page in a Microsoft word document may correspond to a single website page.
You can always rearrange later, but it is preferable to think out the organization first to save effort.

#### Step 3: Design the Map
The pages are arranged into a 2D map, so you need to design this layout.

#### Step 4: Create the Files
The website cannot use (e.g.) Microsoft word files directly.
