### How to share files with your team   

There is an efficient way to share files with your team. 
All files are stored on the web (on a site called github)  
You can view them using a web browser, but the better way is to use a program called 'SourceTree'.
This allows all team members to keep up to date with the latest work.
It also acts as a backup because all old versions are stored safely on the web.
