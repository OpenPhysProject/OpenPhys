## Guide for Authors: How to make an OpenMap Website

### Definitions:
Author: Person who write the lessons  
Content: text, pictures, quizzes etc.

### Tutorial
For this tutorial, we assume that:   
1. You are the author and want to add new content (or modify existing content).   
2. Your web site has already been set up (typically done by IT staff),   
3. You have a team member who will upload your content to the web site. 
The technical processes are explained elsewhere in these doc pages.

#### Step 1: Create the Content for a Lesson
You may already have this content from teaching a course. 
If not, then create it in any format you wish. This will include text, images etc. 

#### Step 2: Organize the content into pages
An OpenMap web site consist of a series of pages, so you will need to arrange your content into this format. 
For instance, each page in a Microsoft word document may correspond to a single web site page, or you 
might use one file for each page.
Although you can always rearrange later, it is preferable to plan the organization first to save effort.

#### Step 3: Design the Map
The pages are arranged into a 2D map, so you need to design this layout. This is described in another document.  

#### Step 4: Create the Text Files
The web site cannot use (e.g.) Microsoft word files directly, so your content needs to be copy and pasted
into a text file. Images are copied as separate files. 
The best way to do this is to find an example file that is similar the style that you want, then just
replace the example text with your text.  
 
You need to use a suitable text editor for this step. 
One recommended one is 'NetBeans', but there are many others. See the separate document on using NetBeans.

#### Step 5: Testing your Content Locally (on your computer)
Although not necessary, it can be very convenient to test a demo version of the web site on your own computer, before uploading to the web.
See the instructions on 'Local Testing'.

#### Step 6: Upload to web site
Give your team-member your finished text files. This is also described in 'Build and Upload'.
