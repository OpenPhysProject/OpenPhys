### OpenPhys
Welcome to the OpenPhys project. 
This project contains a set of mobile web pages physics lessons on radiation physics.
The lessons are presented in a novel 2D map format which we call **OpenMap**.
The web site is designed as 'responsive' to work on any device (phone, tablet etc.)

1. See https://openphys.med.ualberta.ca/ for the deployed site.
2. See the *docs* folder for more documentation on deployment 
and use of the OpenMap design for other projects.
